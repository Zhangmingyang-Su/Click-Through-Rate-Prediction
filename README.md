# Ads Click Through Rate Prediction for Streaming Data

what is the CTR?  
CTR = (click) / (impression)

## Project Summary
In this project, I just handle the cold start issue without users' historical data and demography. I mainly focus on using context feature to predict the probablity of a user who will click the Ads or not. Moreover, I also bring streaming mechanism to illustrate how to simulate streaming data to monitor model performance and CTR changes in real-time.
